# General Relativity Study Circle
Our main goal is to finish Robert Wald's book on general relativity. There are some presentations for each chapter of the book. For the sake of completeness, we may use other books and references as well. By clicking the "General Relativity Study Cricle.pdf" file above, you can see the topics and references of each session. The bullet points represent the answers to the questions asked during lectures. Also, you can find some of the references and related files on this page.
